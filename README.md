HBase Schema:
======
Our HBase schema has the following format: 
```
{ 
	key:string, 
	cf1: {
				address:string,
				crime:string,
				longitude:string,
				latitude:string				
			}, 
	cf2: {
				date:string,
				id:string,
				time:string,
				zipcode:string
			} 
}
```
Our keys are generated by joining the zipcode and crime id together. Column family cf1 stores geolocation, address and crime type, while cf2 stores date and time committed, crime id, and zipcode.
